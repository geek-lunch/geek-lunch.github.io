Geek-lunch organization groups several graduate students at University Laval, most of them studying in ecology. Graduate students present sets of skills that might be useful for other students during their graduate studies. This organization is **led** by students and **for** students. 

Here is the [<i class="fab fa-github-square" style="font-size:18px"></i> repository ](https://github.com/geek-lunch/workshops){target="_blank"} of Geek-lunch organization, where we store scripts on tips about coding, packages skills in R statistical software, but also sometimes other stuff related to biological sciences. 

This repository and web page is updated and maintained by [<i class="fab fa-github-square" style="font-size:18px"></i> F. Dery](https://github.com/florentdery){target="_blank"}. Please not that this website has been created mostly as a hands-on exercise of a Geek-Lunch meeting.
